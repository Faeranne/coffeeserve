CoffeeServe
===========

Coffee-Script server that pre-compiles the nodejs server and web client js

With CoffeeServe, you can build both server and client script in one of the best things since JavaScript, CoffeeScript.

CoffeeServe will automaticaly take your client .coffee files and present them as js to your client, whenever they request them.
Just put your .coffee files in the server/coffee folder, and run node app.js
Presto, instant JavaScript served up on /js/

CoffeeServe uses the Express.js library underneath, ensuring compatablilty with many well known plugins and environments.
